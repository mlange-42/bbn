  Decision network for selecting a diagnostic test.


  There are three tests available, one particularly sensitive (few false-negatives),
  one particularly specific (few false-positives) and one intermediate.


  The decision for a test is based on the infection risk and the cost of treatment,
  relative to the cost of an untreated infection (white nodes).
  Set the values of these two (by clicking the bars) to get a definitive decision.


  Note that, for simplicity, all tests cost the same here, or have a negligible price compared
  to treatment and untreated infections.
