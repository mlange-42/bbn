name: Umbrella Decision Network
info: >-
  Decision network for whether to take an umbrella.
  The agent knows the weather forecast, but weather itself is not observable.


  The umbrella decision (blue) is taken to maximize the utility (green),
  which depends on the actual weather and the decision.

  
  To trigger a decision, set the forecast (white) to a value by clicking a bar.
  To view the complete decision policy, right-click the Umbrella node.


  To inspect utilities, right-click the green utility node.
