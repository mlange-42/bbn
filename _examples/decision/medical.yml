name: Medical Treatment Decision
info: >-
  A decision network for the sequential decisions on whether to test a patient,
  and whether to treat them.


  The decision for testing is based on whether the patient exhibits symptoms.
  Set the "Symptoms" node to a value by clicking a bar.


  The decision for treatment is based on symptoms, whether a test was performed, and the test result.
  Set the test result to get a definitive decision.


  Note that the actual infection state of the patient is not known for the decisions.
  Also note that it is a severe disease, which is very cheap to treat.
  Therefore, the optimal policy might be unexpected.
