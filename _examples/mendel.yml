  Mendel's experiment of breeding red and white flowered peas.


  White nodes show observable colors of parents and offspring,
  while gray nodes are unobservable genetics.


  'R' is the dominant allele for red flowers,
  'w' is the recessive allele for white flowers.


  Set evidence on some nodes by clicking the bars.
  Observe the behavior of other nodes.
