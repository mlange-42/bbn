# Examples

This folder contains examples of Bayesian networks in bbn's YAML format.
Examples are structured in sub-directories:

- `bbn` contains basic Bayesian Belief Networks.
- `decision` contains decision networks with alias influence diagrams.
- `logic` contains networks that solve logic puzzles or reasoning problems.

Use the terminal application `bbni` to explore the example networks and view their detailed descriptions.

It is recommended to also view some of the examples using a text editor, to get an understanding of the YAML format
and network definition in general.
