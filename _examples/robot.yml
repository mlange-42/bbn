name: Robot Decision
info:
  The famous robot decision network example.


  the robot has to choose between a short and a long route,
  where the short route harbours the risk of an accident.
  Further, the robot decides whether to wear protective pads
  to reduce damage in case of an accident.


  The decision is already taken, as it does not depend on any information.
  You can set the value of "Accident" by clicking a bar,
  and observe the expected utility.
