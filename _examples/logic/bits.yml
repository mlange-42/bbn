name: Decimal/binary converter
info: >-
  A simple logic network to combine a list of binary nodes
  to a decimal integer number.


  Select an integer value (by clicking a bar) to get its bit.
  Alternatively, set individual bits to get the resulting decimal integer value.
variables:

- variable: Bit-1
  position: [1, 0]
  outcomes: [T, F]
  table: 
  - [1, 1]
  
- variable: Bit-2
  position: [1, 6]
  outcomes: [T, F]
  table: 
  - [1, 1]
  
- variable: Bit-3
  position: [1, 12]
  outcomes: [T, F]
  table: 
  - [1, 1]
  
- variable: Bit-4
  position: [1, 18]
  outcomes: [T, F]
  table: 
  - [1, 1]

- variable: Integer
  position: [33, 2]
  outcomes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
  given: [Bit-1, Bit-2, Bit-3, Bit-4]
