  Example for simple boolean logic operators.


  Play with setting the white nodes to some values by clicking the bars.
  Observe which combinations of A, B and C result in which outcome of the right-most node.
  Also try setting the right-most node's outcome to T (True), and observe which combinations of
  A, B and C are valid when you set some of these incoming variables.
variables:

- variable: A
  position: [1, 0]
  outcomes: [T, F]
  table: 
  - [1, 1]
  
- variable: B
  position: [1, 6]
  outcomes: [T, F]
  table: 
  - [1, 1]
  
- variable: C
  position: [1, 12]
  outcomes: [T, F]
  table: 
  - [1, 1]
  
- variable: A and B
  position: [33, 3]
  color: gray
  outcomes: [T, F]
  given: [A, B]
  logic: and

- variable: "!B and C"
  position: [33, 9]
  color: gray
  outcomes: [T, F]
  given: [B, C]
  logic: not-and

- variable: (A and B) or (!B and C)
  position: [65, 6]
  outcomes: [T, F]
  given: [A and B, "!B and C"]
  logic: or
